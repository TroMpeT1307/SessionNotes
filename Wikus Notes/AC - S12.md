## Gray Maw Attack on Flumph
Genna kakked on Cpt Anderson after the gray maw attack
He was suspicious of the Duck Crew for some reason . 

He did not know what was in the crates and was just smuggling them off to the Dragon Isles. 
Took the crates and was on their way to deliver them no questions asked. A Courier dropped off the crates so he is not sure exactly where it came from for a hefty sum of gold. 

Inside of the crates were covered with some linens and with some closer inspection form Josie there seemed to be **runic scratch marks** inside the crates. Runes are a form of Alarm spell that triggers when magic is cast in close proximity. 

15 Gray maw are deadly enough to take down some nobles. 
Who ever was going to collect the crates were to meet up with Cpt Anderson at the docks in Dragon Isles. Everything was paid in advance.

## Gray Maw Origin
Letalis got some word from his friend *Nasumento*. 
He thinks the disappearances in the shanty town are linked to the Gray Maw. 

Nasumento found a Gray Maw disguise in the factory in Procampur
Mayor of Procampur has been ruling for ~50 years. There have been weird disappearances during majority of his reign as mayor. 

Nasumento seems real interested in what we know regarding the Gray Maw. 

Izzy gave Gideon a flask of mead from Tsurlagol.

### [Standing on the Edge - Kurt Darren](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdGIGiSoAKo)

At the Darren Island we went to check out the "Beached" Sloop. 

There are **Runic Marks** in the crates in the beached sloop as well. 

We went to look for ol' Kurt on Darren island but his house was filled with dried blood splatter with a blood trail that led out of the window. 

Candles and Fire seems Fresh and not as old as all the blood. Kurt has no Eyes and No Arms. 
Gray Maw attacked the Ducks. 

Gideon passed out and turned pale and had no nose.
