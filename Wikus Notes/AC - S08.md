Seems like there was a meeting in the Guild Hideout

Guild leader will be at the tavern tonight meeting some dwarves

A ledger was found that has items in it that when comparing to the Guilds ledger their version is empty 

Some **700,000 GP** worth of transactions in the following regions
- Ravensbell
- Port Ivory 
- Port Ebony 
- Nori
- Prancevale
- Beachfront
- Aurora

Still not sure if there is a finders fee.

- Red Eyes 
- Elf 
- Archer
- White hair

None of the above places are on any of our found atlases. 
The ledger was in a lead lined safe.
