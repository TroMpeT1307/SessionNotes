Met Turnble and Litalis in the fake cavern thing

Turnble wants to find his way home (could be the ale coast) -> Tastes copper

Litalis was a spymaster 

**Procampur mayor had a perfume that makes the wearer smell normal -> Au du Normal**

Got more items and a note from V in the cart of mayor

>[!Note] Note from V
>“By the time the festival ends, most will have already boarded under the guise of exploration. Let the eager ones pave the road. I care not for discovery, only departure.
> 
> Ensure the chosen wear their marks beneath their garments. The cleric’s vessel must not be delayed—her awakening is essential.
> 
> Do not involve the Tsurlagol fool beyond coin-counting.
> 
> —V.”

Drow Bitch dont like us -> Kegger said this

Mayor of procampur might be part of some thieves guilds 
he is a recluse. 

Letalis might be the son of mayor iron fist. thought he only had 1 son. 

Turnble had red mark under his glove.

After giving Holti & Nolti the coins they gave us an inert wand with the symbol of the ironfists on 
`this will trigger when ready`

Letalis organised everything for Turnble
