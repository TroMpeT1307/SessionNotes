Bought Nets and Rods for fishing off boat

Thieves Guild lost money that has been stolen and they need to follow the money

 Orc has brought the *Lute* for the arena fight. - Don't know who it is atm 

#### Team 
A voting system has been established - A democracy
We can use Gold for bloodsport but any gold that we then get from said bloodsport or use will then get added to the [[SessionNotes/Party Inventory| Party Fund]] 

We established that we have Turnble that can heal, Josie can heal as well

Amsel said that he could heal as well and did not want to show Gideon how so Gideon stabbed himself so that Amsel could show him 
>[!Warning] AMSEL CAN'T HEAL 
>The mother fucker lied -_-

Josie has brothers
James has parents one is a Cpt and the other is very scary

Toys has been given back to the kids no coin as a result as any job listing needs to be given to the guild hall so receive payment

#### Shanty town
Its rundown and made of plank houses
Thieves can't marks the Safehouses, Hideaways(Place to hide goods not people, like a cache) and Fence
Bathilda (Big Babushka lady) friend of Red Jak told Jak that the guards are taking people from the shanty town! **2 Per week** The Thieves guild had noticed and started moving around a lot more. 

Bathilda pointed Jak in the direction of the temporary hall and gave him the password to get in. 

>[!Note] Thieves Guild Knock Pattern
>Knock 3 times, Pause, Knock once again

There was a guy that followed Amsel and stole his coin. 
`You must be real stupid flipping that coin or you are lookin for someone? - Dude`
`I can show you someone real stupid - Amsel`
